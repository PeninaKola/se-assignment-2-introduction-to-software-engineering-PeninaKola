# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineerin principles, method and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems. It encompasses the entire software development process. Traditional programming primarily focuses on writing code to create software applications. It’s a narrower role compared to software engineering. software engineering encompasses a broader spectrum, emphasizing systematic processes, architecture, and quality, whereas traditional programming is more focused on writing code to achieve specific functionality.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is iterative and incremmental approach focused on  flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Waterfall  is a sequential approach with distinct phases including requirement, design, or implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall. 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile has sprints while waterfall does not
agile is self organizing unlike waterfall
Waterfall is structured and sequential, while Agile is iterative and adaptive.
Agile is mostly used for longterm while waterfall is used for shortterm
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engeneering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It plays a crucial role in both systems engineering and software engineering
The processes include ; Requirements interception, requirement analysis and negotiation, system modeling, requirement specification and requirement validation.
importances include; Risk mitigation, steakholder allignment,Precise Specifications, cost and time saving, quality assurance. 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software engineering refers to the design approach that emphasizes the separation of concerns. 
Debugging and maintenance become simplified and easy.
Modular components can be reused across different areas or projects.
Additional modules can be added to enhance or expand features.
Increases productivity and teamwork.
Isolating issues within modules allows for targeted testing and rectification.
There is easy debugging and troubleshooting
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing:Focuses on individual components (such as methods or functions) to ensure their correctness and functionality, automated to catch bugs early in the development process.Example:Verifying that a calculator program correctly adds two numbers together.
Integration Testing:Checks how different components work together,Ensures data flows correctly between modules.
Detects issues related to interactions between components.Example: Verifying that data from one module is correctly processed by another
System Testing:Evaluates both functional and non-functional requirements of the entire system. Verifies that the software meets stakeholder-specified criteria. Covers end-to-end scenarios. Example: Testing the entire expense tracking app to ensure it meets user needs.
Acceptance Testing: Validates whether the software meets specified requirements. Ensures compliance with contracts or specifications. Determines if the software is ready for deployment. Example: Checking if the app’s features align with user expectations.
Testing is essential because it:
Identifies defects early, reducing costs and risks.
Ensures software quality and reliability.
Boosts user confidence by delivering bug-free products.
Validates that the software meets business and user needs
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are essential tools in software development that manage changes to source code and related files. They allow developers to track modifications, collaborate effectively, and maintain different versions of their projects.
They are important in that they help in; Streamlined Release Management, conflict prevention d anTracking Changes to Digital Artifacts
Examples include Git, subversion and mercurial.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Challenges include; Project Planning and Scheduling, Requirements Gathering and Analysis, risk management, tea coordination and communication, quality assurance and testing.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintenance is providing outgoing support, updates and enhancements to the softwate after deployment.
Maintenance is important in that, maintenance sustains software health, longevity, and user satisfaction.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The possible ethical issues involve, alogarithm biasness,personal data collection, weak security collection and feature ipact relationships.
Software engineers can understand ethical guidances,, be accountable and honest to adhere to the ethical standards in their work.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
